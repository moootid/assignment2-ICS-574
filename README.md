# Big Data Assignment - Review of Fundamentals

This repository contains the materials and report for a Big Data assignment focused on reviewing fundamental concepts in Python programming, basic statistics, and core programming principles using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment involved reviewing three Jupyter Notebooks:

1.  **Python Review**: Reinforcing core Python skills.
2.  **Basic Statistics Review**: Revisiting essential statistical concepts.
3.  **Basic Programming Concepts**: Covering fundamental programming practices.

The task was to execute each notebook, understand the code, and write a report summarizing the key learnings from each.

## Repository Contents

* **Python\_review.pdf**: PDF document of the "Python Review" notebook.
* **Review\_Basic\_statistics.pdf**: PDF document of the "Basic Statistics Review" notebook.
* **Topic\_4\_Basic\_programming\_concepts.pdf**: PDF document of the "Basic Programming Concepts" notebook.
* **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Report Summary

### Python Review

The "Python Review" notebook refreshed fundamental Python programming skills, including list comprehensions, `enumerate` and `zip` functions, dictionary operations, string methods, lambda functions, and the `map` function. It also provided an introduction to the NumPy library for efficient numerical computations.

### Basic Statistics Review

The "Basic Statistics Review" notebook defined fundamental statistical concepts such as data, variables, and tabular data representation. It covered different field types, including numerical and categorical data, and explained how to calculate and interpret descriptive statistics like mean, median, and quartiles. It also covered boxplots and hypothesis testing using t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests.

### Basic Programming Concepts

The "Basic Programming Concepts" notebook covered essential programming concepts using Pandas. It focused on DataFrames, their creation from CSV and Excel files, data access, slicing, sorting, conditional selection, applying functions to DataFrame elements, and data visualization using Seaborn.
